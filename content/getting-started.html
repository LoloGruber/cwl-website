## Resources for Getting Started
Below are some useful resources to getting started.  Additionally, help is available through [community resources]({{ site.url }}/#community) such as the [CWL Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language).

* Learn to write CWL using the [CWL user guide]({{ site.url }}/user_guide/) which provides a gentle introduction to creating CWL command line tool and workflow descriptions.
* Browse [CWL Implementations]({{ site.url }}/#Implementations) to find a software package that's right for you.
* Follow [CWL Recommended Practices](http://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/rec-practices/) to make your CWL tools and workflows more efficent, reusable and transparent.
* Watch <a href="https://github.com/pitagora-galaxy/cwl/wiki/CWL-Start-Guide-JP" lang="ja" hreflang="ja">CWLの日本語での解説ドキュメント</a>, a 15-minute introduction to the CWL project in Japanese.
* Watch a series of [video lessons about CWL](https://stepik.org/lesson/35918/step/1?unit=15070) in Russian as part of the <a href="https://stepik.org/course/1612/syllabus" lang="ru">Управление вычислениями</a> (Computation Management) free online course.
* Find [CWL descriptions for life-science tools](https://github.com/common-workflow-library/bio-cwl-tools) to use directly or incoporate into your workflows.

## Background 
### Why Use Workfows?

Workflows and using workflow tools help make your computational methods portable, maintainable, reproducible and shareable. Often analysis methods contain many steps, perhaps in multiple languages and workflows help researchers document, run and maintain these complicated analyses.
Using a workflow system rather than a series of scripts has a number of benefits including abstraction, scaling, automation, and provenance (ASAP).
<br>
Workflows enable a clear abstraction about the components of your analysis, the relationship between the components and the inputs and outputs for each component allows for a well-labeled analysis with documented expectation. This abstraction helps enable the other benefits of scaling, automation and provenance.
Workflow execution can be parallelized or distributed making use of cluster, cloud, and high performance computing (HPC) environments. This helps to solve larger problems and analyze larger datasets faster.

Automation helps when running repetitive pipelines for example when running parameter sweeps or the same analysis on different sets of data. Workflow engines can use the inherient abstraction of workflows to efficently track, plan and manage the executation of workflow components.
Lastly, provenance tracking helps with auditing, tranparency, and validation. Ultimately, using workflows in the long run helps save time and effort and allows for easier scaling, tracking, sharing and reuse.

### Why Use a Standard?

A standard for sharing and reusing workflows can provide a solution to describing portable, re-usable workflows while also being workflow-engine and vendor-neutral.
Although workflows are very popular, prior to the CWL standards every workflow system was incompatible with every other. This means, those users not using the CWL standards are required to express their computational workflows in a different way every time they have to use another workflow system. This greatly hampers reuse and collaboration.

### When to Use CWL?

The CWL standards were designed for a particular style of
command-line tool based data analysis.
CWL is for dataflow style batch analysis consisting of command line programs. It is not designed for supporting safe interaction with stateful (web) services, real-time communication between workflow steps, or workflows that need particular steps run at or during a
specific day/time frame.
